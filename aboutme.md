subtitle: Why I'm Taking Electronic Textiles
---

My name is Onassa, and my goal for the spring 2023 semester is to understand and model the way digital data interacts with humans through interactive technology devices. The reason I am taking E-Textiles and not Intro to Computer Science is that I am chiefly interested in the human experience, and E-Textiles lies at the intersection of humanity and computers. I hope to demonstrate the positive impact that interactive technology devices can have on people by creating a Squishmallow that will randomly play a pre-recorded message from one of my friends every time time I hug it. My hope is that this new and improved Squishmallow can improve mental health by keeping people's loved ones nearby at all times. Ultimately, I hope my project will exemplify the incredible positive potential of human-aligned technology devices.
