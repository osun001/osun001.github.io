For this assignment, I wrote a program that would play Mary Had A Little Lamb on the buzzer whenever the slide switch is turned on. My advice to past self would be to be careful about repetitive notes because if you don't put a no tone in between the same note it will just sound like that note played once for a really long time.

Citation: I got the sheet music for Mary Had a Little Lamb from https://www.music-for-music-teachers.com/mary-had-a-little-lamb.html
