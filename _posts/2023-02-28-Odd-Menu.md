For this assignment, I made a program that will describe what meal a person will get depending on their numberChoice (if the integer is odd, they will get the secret menu, and if even, they will get the regular menu) and which meal option they choose (1, 2, or 3). It was fun asking my friends for foods that they like and I was very satisfied by the smooth and efficient logic that the program uses. A piece of advice that I would give to my past self is to break down the logic before I start coding because all of the text starts to get confusing and makes it easier for me to lose track of where I am in the process.
