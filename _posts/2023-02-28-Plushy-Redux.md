For this assignment, I created a program that mimics my lovely plushy insofar that it will output a description of whether or not the three LEDs are on or off depending on the pressed/unpressed status of the button and the on/off status of the switch. A tip I would give to my past self is to be efficient with my code and try to narrow down the one situation in which things happen (the button is pressed and the switch is on) in order to minimize the amount of code I need to write.
