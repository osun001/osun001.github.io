For this assignment, I wrote a program that would make my red LED and RGB LED light up when it is dark or cold enough for there to be... GHOSTS!!! A tip to my past self would be to make sure that the connection for my LEDs is intact because, at first, my off-board LED would not turn off and I was very confused until Dylan came to my rescue!
