For this assignment, I essentially put together all of the code for my three fireflies so my Arduino will simulate the flashes of all of the fireflies at once. This was fairly easy for me, but a tip I would give to myself is to really put in the work for the first assignment because that made this assignment so much easier since I only had one timer and interval variable for all of them!
