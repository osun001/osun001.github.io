I struggled quite a bit with this assignment (I wanted to pull out the little hair that I have for 2.75 of the 3 hours I spent on it), but ultimately I figured it out, much to my relief and satisfaction! I really wanted to be able to figure out how to solve the problem on my own, so while I would have been less stressed if I waited for office hours, I am really glad that I struggled through it myself because I now have a very solid understanding of the logic behind all of the statements and the way they fit together. My program will output the color of an LED every tenth time the loop runs, with each color appearing a maximum of three times before moving on to the next color. A tip I would give to my past self is to write out my logic on paper because I ultimately think better through writing and this is what helped me figure out the correct logic in the end!
