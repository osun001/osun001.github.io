For this project, I wrote code to simulate the flashes of the flashbulb firefly, the big dipper firefly, and the synchronous firefly! It was a little tricky but also quite fun to figure out how to make the Arduino flash once every four seconds for the flashbulb, increase in glow for the big dipper, and flash three times consecutively for the synchronous! I made the effort to use the "hard method" so hopefully the next assignment will be easier for me! A tip I would give to myself is to really write out the pseudocode because that makes you think more about what the code is actually supposed to do, as opposed to just blindly writing out a bunch of code.
