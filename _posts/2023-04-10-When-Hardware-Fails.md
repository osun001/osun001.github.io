For this assignment, I wrote a program that would make the RGB LED turn on in a random color every time it is continuously pressed. My tip to myself would be to talk through my logic with someone because that helped me ensure that I wasn't missing a piece of the puzzle. Unfortunately, my Arduino was acting up so I couldn't take a picture of my code working, but I am very confident in the logic of my code and I am praying that Iris can help me fix this problem!
