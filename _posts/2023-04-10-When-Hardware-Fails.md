For this assignment, I wrote a program that would make my RGB LED turn on in a random color every time it is continuously pressed. My tip to myself would be to talk through my logic with someone because that helped me ensure that I wasn't missing a piece of the puzzle. Iris helped me fix a problem with my Arudino (the port wouldn't show up on my computer) so now I actually have a picture of it working! Yay!
