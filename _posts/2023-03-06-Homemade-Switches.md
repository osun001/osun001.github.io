For this assignment, I created a circuit with two homemade switches that, when pressed, will light up an LED! For one of my switches, you need to press two square-shaped patches of conductive thread together to close the circuit. For the other switch, I sewed a conductive thread patch and a heart-shaped piece of conductive fabric that can be moved to cover it and close the circuit. A tip I would give to myself if I were to do this again is to think a bit more about design quality because while my circuit definitely works (and on the first try, too!) it's a bit of a hassle to press the two thread patches together, and this also gets in the way of my other switch and my LED.
