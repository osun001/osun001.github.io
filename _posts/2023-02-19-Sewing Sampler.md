When I was working on the first version of my sewing sampler, I didn't have an embroidery hoop so the excess fabric kept on getting in the way of my needle and thread. To make past Onassa's life easier, I would tell her to go to the Fabrication Lab at Sawyer as soon as class ended to get an embroidery hoop. All in all, I realy enjoyed working on this sampler at the Jiminy Peak lodge while my two crazy friends went skiing in the 50 degree weather. Sewing was a good way of turning off my mind for a while and just focusing on my handiwork.
