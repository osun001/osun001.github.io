For my final project, I decided to make a snap-on flower to make walking around in the dark more bright and fun! My flower will continuously change colors when it senses that it is dark (also a very good way of making sure cars can see you when crossing Route 2 at night!), and for an extra fun spin, two pink LEDs on the petals will alternately flash when the switch is turned on. As someone who just started wearing jeans recently, I really wanted to express myself and have some fun with accessories. A friend of mine has these beautiful orange flowers embroidered onto her jeans, and I decided to go even further and make my flower interactive!

Three Tips To My Past Self
1. Spend a lot of time on the paper prototype to make sure circuits do not overlapâ€”makes execution significantly easier!
2. Use tape to tape down the ends of the conductive thread to make sure things don't accidentally short circuit
3. I wish I spent more time planning how I would make my flower aesthetically pleasing since I focused mainly on functionality

Materials List:
- 3 Metal Snaps
- Light Blue Felt
- Conductive Thread
- Embroidery Floss
- Scissor & Needle
- 1 Lilypad USB Plus
- 2 Pink LEDs
- 1 Lilypad Light Sensor
- 1 Lilypad Switch
- 1 Battery
