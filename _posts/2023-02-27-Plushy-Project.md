While my plushy admittedly doesn't look like much, I learned quite a bit in the process of making it! First, I made a paper prototype of how my battery would connect to my LEDs, button, and switch, and then I used this to make a working prototype using alligator clips and the actual electronic components. I then used conductive thread for the first time and sewed my components onto the felt, connecting the postiives to the positives and the negatives to the negatives (this phrase is stuck in my head now). I remember being so happy when my LEDs lit up correctly on the first try, and sewing up the plushy and stuffing it was a piece of cake. While my plushy is definitely far from perfect, I am really proud of myself for finishing my first project. 

A tip I would give to someone who is completing this project for the first time is that one of the most improtant things is to make sure none of your threads are touching each other because that will close your circuit (aka it won't work). Fortunately, this didn't happen to me, but that was because Iris kept on telling the people around me that their issue was that the threads were connecting, so I definitely learned the lesson through osmosis.
