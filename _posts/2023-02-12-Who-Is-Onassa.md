My name is Onassa and I am a sophomore majoring in Comparative Literature. I have no prior experience with sewing or programming, but I am very excited to acquire the skills necessary to make the Squishmallow of my dreams â€” that is, a Squishmallow that will speak to me every time I hug it. A boring fact about me is that I think tree branches in winter look like neurons.
