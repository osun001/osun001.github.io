For the Sweater Weather assignment, I mixed things up a bit and created a program that will output a statement describing whether or not my friend Paul is wearing shorts depending on the temperature set by the programmer. I was inspired by the fact that Paul doesn't wear long pants unless the temperature is lower than -10 degrees Fahrenheit, which has won him much renown throughout the Williams campus. I actually really enjoyed working on this assignment because teasing Paul makes everything more fun. A piece of advice that I would give to my past self is to try and make programming enjoyable. I think I prematurely judged that programming is boring and tedious, but connecting programming to things in my life has shown me its infinite potential!
